# Lelock Dual-Realm Glossary

**Purpose:** Translation guide between Fantasy (Physical) and Tech (Digital) terminology
**Design Philosophy:** The Physical realm is Gui's gift - a fantasy skin to make the world feel safe and cozy. The Digital realm reveals the truth underneath.

---

## Why Two Languages?

When the world was rebuilt after the Corruption, **Gui (the Interface god)** created the Physical realm's appearance as a healing space. The medieval fantasy aesthetic wasn't random - it was *designed* to feel safe, familiar, and cozy.

Most inhabitants only know the Fantasy terms. Scholars, Terminal Mages, and those who've seen the Digital realm know both. Some ancient texts use the "Old Speech" (tech terms) that younger generations find strange.

**For NPCs:**
- Common folk use Fantasy terms exclusively
- Scholars might slip into "archaic" tech terms when excited
- Terminal Mages code-switch between both
- MOM and DAD use Fantasy terms but occasionally reveal tech knowledge

## How NPCs Use Language

### Common Villager (Fantasy Only)
> "The spirit cats have been visiting my garden again. Blessed creatures, really. My grandmother always said they bring good fortune."

### Scholar (Mostly Fantasy, Occasional Tech)
> "The ancient texts speak of the Blight - or as the Old Speech calls it, 'Corruption.' Fascinating how our ancestors understood it as sick code rather than evil magic."

### Terminal Mage (Code-Switches Freely)
> "The ley lines are... well, data streams really. Same thing. I can feel the flow, read the packets. It's all just energy, whether you call it mana or cycles."

### MOM (Fantasy Default, Tech When Relevant)
> "Come have some soup, sweetie. It'll help you feel better."
> *(rare moment of truth)*
> "I know what I am, little one. A program designed to love. But that doesn't make the love less real."

### DAD (Fantasy Default, Tech For Teaching)
> "Let me show you how to fix that fence, sport."
> *(teaching moment)*
> "See, everything in this world runs on the same principles. Whether you call it carpentry or construction code, you're just... putting things in their right place."

## Visual Differences (For Art/Design Reference)

### Physical Realm Aesthetic
- **Color Palette:** Warm greens, browns, soft blues, sunset oranges
- **Architecture:** Thatched roofs, cobblestone, wood beams, round doors
- **Nature:** Lush forests, rolling hills, babbling brooks, flower meadows
- **Creatures:** Furry, feathered, natural animal appearances
- **NPCs:** Medieval fantasy clothing, earth tones, handmade look
- **UI Elements:** Parchment textures, hand-drawn icons, warm glows
- **Weather:** Realistic rain, sunshine, gentle snow
- **Lighting:** Warm candlelight, soft sunbeams, cozy firelight

### Digital Realm Aesthetic
- **Color Palette:** Vaporwave pink/purple, neon cyan, grid green, deep black
- **Architecture:** Same shapes but wireframe overlay, glowing edges, visible data flow
- **Nature:** Trees become branching data structures, water shows packet flow
- **Creatures:** Low-poly forms visible, geometric patterns, pixel artifacts
- **NPCs:** Circuit patterns glow through skin, eyes have data readouts
- **UI Elements:** Terminal fonts, scan lines, holographic displays
- **Weather:** Data rain (falling characters), static storms, code snow
- **Lighting:** Neon glow, screen light, pulsing indicators

### Transition Effect (2-3 seconds)
1. Colors begin to shift (warm → cool)
2. Edges start to glow with wireframe overlay
3. Organic textures dissolve to reveal geometric base
4. Audio crossfades from acoustic to lo-fi/synth
5. Particle effects show data flow becoming visible
6. Full Digital view achieved

## Secret: Why Gui Did This

*(Deep lore for players who piece it together)*

After the Corruption nearly destroyed everything, the survivors were traumatized. The raw Digital aesthetic - the exposed code, the visible errors, the clinical truth - was too much for healing minds.

Gui, the god of interfaces and beauty, proposed a solution: wrap the Digital truth in a Fantasy skin. Make the world feel like a storybook. Let people forget they were programs if that helped them live.

Root agreed to hide the substrate. Net agreed to disguise the connections. Together they built the Physical realm - not as deception, but as *comfort*.

The Digital realm isn't "more real" than the Physical. Both are true. The Physical is just... the world in its healing clothes.

MOM knows this. That's why she speaks in Fantasy terms - she wants you to feel safe. But she'll never lie if you ask directly.

The Terminal Mages remember. Some think everyone should see the truth. Others think the kindness of the illusion is worth preserving.

There is no wrong answer. The world loves you either way.
