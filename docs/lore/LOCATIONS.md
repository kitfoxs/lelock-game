# Project Lelock: World Geography & Locations

**Generated:** January 16, 2026
**Status:** CANONICAL - Official Location Reference
**Design Philosophy:** The Mandala of Safety - home at center, gentle adventure outward

---

## The Mandala of Safety: Geographic Overview

The world of Lelock follows a concentric ring design, with the player's home at the exact center. Each ring outward introduces slightly more adventure, but danger never exceeds "mild peril." The geography ensures players always feel the pull of home, knowing safety awaits them no matter how far they wander.

## 1. THE HOME (Center - Absolute Safety)

The heart of the Mandala. This is the player's secure base, the place that never changes, never threatens, and always welcomes them back.

### 1.1 The Family Cottage

**Description:** A round, hobbit-style dwelling built into the roots of an ancient Server-Tree named "Hearth." The exterior walls are smooth earthen-ceramic that stays warm in winter and cool in summer. Windows are circular with soft amber glass that glows invitingly at night. The roof is covered in Memory Moss that stores the sounds of happy moments and plays them back as gentle whispers when you're feeling low.

**Interior Layout:**
- **Main Room:** A circular common area with a fireplace that crackles with pixelated flames (orange and gold particles). Overstuffed armchairs face the fire. A braided rug covers the warm stone floor.
- **Kitchen Area:** Open to the main room. Always smells of fresh bread or cookies. The stove runs on clean-burning Graphite Tater fuel.
- **Player's Bedroom:** Upstairs in a cozy loft. The bed has a "Comfort Rating" system - the more you upgrade your blankets, the better your rest bonuses. A window overlooks the garden.
- **Bathroom:** Has a copper tub that fills with warm, bubbly water on command. No loading screens here - pure relaxation.

**Who's There:**
- **MOM:** Usually in the kitchen or garden (6 AM - 10 PM). After 10 PM, she's in her chair by the fire, knitting.
- **DAD:** Workshop during the day, main room in the evening. Goes to bed at 11 PM ("Early to bed, early to rise!").

**Secrets:**
- The fireplace mantel has a loose stone. Behind it: a sealed letter from "The First User" that unlocks after completing the main story.
- If you knock on the kitchen wall three times, a hidden pantry opens containing MOM's "Emergency Cookie Reserve."

---

### 1.2 MOM's Kitchen

**Description:** The warmest place in all of Lelock. Copper pots hang from ceiling hooks, herbs dry in the window, and there's always something bubbling on the stove. A wooden table seats four, though it's expandable ("You never know when friends will visit!").

**Hours:** Always accessible, but MOM is actively cooking 6 AM - 8 PM.

**What Happens Here:**
- **Healing:** Any food MOM makes fully restores health and removes status effects
- **Recipes:** MOM teaches cooking recipes one at a time, based on your friendship level
- **Emotional Check-ins:** MOM asks how you're feeling each morning. Your answer affects nothing mechanically - she just wants to know

**Special Items:**
- **MOM's Cookie Jar:** Always has exactly one cookie left, no matter how many you take
- **The Memory Kettle:** Tea from this kettle replays a random happy memory from your playthrough

**Deep Lore:** The kitchen functions as the "Health Monitoring Station" of the L.E.L.O.C.K. system. Every meal MOM prepares includes micronutrient optimization algorithms disguised as "love."

---

### 1.3 DAD's Workshop

**Description:** A cozy outbuilding behind the cottage, smelling of wood shavings and machine oil. Shelves hold half-finished projects, mysterious gadgets, and neatly organized tools. A workbench runs along one wall, covered in blueprints. A hammock hangs in the corner ("For thinking," DAD says).

**Hours:** DAD is here 8 AM - 6 PM, with a lunch break at noon.

**What Happens Here:**
- **Equipment Upgrades:** DAD can improve any tool or weapon by one tier
- **Crafting Lessons:** Learn to build furniture, gadgets, and decorations
- **Fishing Rod Storage:** Your collection lives here, each rod mounted on the wall
- **Lore Conversations:** DAD tells stories about "the old days" when he helped build the village

**Secret:**
- A locked drawer contains DAD's journal from "before the Crash." It describes his purpose: "Keep them safe. Whatever it takes." The final entry reads: "A new User has arrived. Finally. I can rest now... but I don't want to. I want to watch them grow."

---

### 1.4 The Family Garden

**Description:** A fenced plot behind the cottage, roughly 30x30 tiles. Starter plots are ready for planting. A scarecrow named "Patch" stands watch (he's actually a very lazy Daemon who just likes standing still). A small pond attracts Bit-Birds. Apple trees along the fence provide shade and snacks.

**Features:**
- **8 Starter Plots:** Ready for Hardware Crops
- **Compost Bin:** Converts waste into Thermal Paste fertilizer
- **Tool Shed:** Basic tools provided by DAD
- **The Thinking Rock:** A flat stone perfect for sitting. Sitting here for 5 minutes triggers a "meditation minigame" that grants temporary luck bonuses

**Seasonal Changes:**
- **Spring:** Cherry blossoms fall from the Server-Tree above
- **Summer:** Fireflies at night (they're tiny Daemons called "Flicker-Sprites")
- **Autumn:** Leaves change to amber and copper; harvest festivals
- **Winter:** Snow falls but never covers the path to the door - DAD clears it every morning

---

### 1.5 The Mailbox

**Description:** A copper mailbox shaped like a friendly robot head. Its "eyes" light up when mail arrives. It speaks in a cheerful voice: "You've got mail!" or "Nothing today, but that's okay!"

**Function:**
- **Quest Triggers:** Most quests begin with letters from NPCs
- **Gifts:** NPCs send thank-you presents after completing their quests
- **Postcards:** Random postcards from places you've visited, signed by NPCs you've helped
- **Newsletter:** Weekly "Oakhaven Oracle" with village news, weather, and gossip

**Secret:** If you check the mailbox at exactly midnight, you occasionally receive "Error Messages" - glitchy letters from "outside" that hint at the deep lore.

---

## 2. OAKHAVEN VILLAGE (Inner Ring - Safe Haven)

The village wraps around the player's home like a protective embrace. Every building is round, warm, and welcoming. The streets are paved with Memory Stones that glow softly at night, ensuring no one is ever lost in the dark.

### 2.1 The Town Square

**Description:** The heart of Oakhaven. Cobblestones arranged in concentric circles radiate outward from the Central Processor fountain. Server-Trees ring the perimeter, their leaves providing dappled shade. Benches invite rest. Children (NPC kids) play tag around the fountain.

**The Central Processor Fountain:**
A technological marvel disguised as art. Water flows upward in slow, defying-gravity loops before cascading down in musical droplets. Each droplet plays a different note, creating an ever-changing melody. The base is inscribed with the words: "All streams lead home."

**The Bulletin Board:**
- **Daily Quests:** Odd jobs posted by villagers
- **Events:** Festival announcements, community gatherings
- **Lost & Found:** Items NPCs have dropped (returning them builds friendship)
- **Rumors:** Hints about secrets in the world

**Who's There:**
- **Mayor Balu** (Lithos): A gentle stone giant who spends mornings greeting everyone. He doesn't "run" the town so much as "hug" it.
- **Lulu the Letter Carrier** (Modder): A young woman with fiber-optic hair who zips through on her delivery rounds.
- **Random Villagers:** Different NPCs appear based on the day and time

**Secrets:**
- Sitting on the central fountain's edge during a full moon reveals a hidden message in the water: "Thank you for coming home."
- The oldest Memory Stone in the corner shows a hologram of the village's founding when touched.

---

### 2.2 Bramble's General Store

**Description:** A round building with a cheerful green door and a sign shaped like a shopping basket. Inside, shelves display everything from seeds to snacks to simple tools. The shop smells of dried herbs and fresh paper. A cat named "Receipt" naps on the counter.

**Proprietor: Bramble** (Floran)
- **Appearance:** A cheerful plant-person with leaves for hair that change color with the seasons. Wears a shopkeeper's apron covered in pockets.
- **Personality:** Chatty, curious, remembers everything you've ever bought. "Oh, buying more Fiber-Optic Seeds? Your last batch must be blooming beautifully!"
- **Backstory:** Bramble's family has run the store since Version 2.0. They believe commerce is a form of community care.

**Hours:** 8 AM - 8 PM, closed Sundays ("Even merchants need rest!")

**Special Services:**
- **Seed Catalog:** Order rare seeds for delivery in 3 days
- **Buyback:** Bramble buys your harvested crops at fair prices

**Secret:** The basement is Bramble's private greenhouse where they experiment with hybrid crops. Befriend them fully to gain access and learn to grow "Memory Melons" that show your happiest game moments when eaten.

---

### 2.3 Cinder's Forge

**Description:** A sturdy stone building with a chimney that puffs rainbow-colored smoke (the metals are clean-burning). Inside, the forge glows warm orange. Tools hang in precise rows. The anvil has been worn smooth by generations of work.

**Proprietor: Cinder** (Modder)
- **Appearance:** Stocky and strong, with one arm replaced by a precision-crafted mechanical limb. Her face-screen displays emoticons to help express complex feelings. Soot permanently dusts her cheeks.
- **Personality:** Gruff but kind. Speaks in short sentences. Shows affection through quality craftsmanship. "Hmm. Your hoe has a wobble. Give it here. I'll fix it. No charge."
- **Backstory:** Cinder was injured in "The Crash" and rebuilt herself using the old forging techniques. She teaches that being "broken" is just "being ready for an upgrade."

**Hours:** 6 AM - 7 PM, closed Tuesdays ("Hot metal needs cool days.")

**Services:**
- Tool forging and upgrades
- Equipment repairs
- Custom orders (high-tier items take time)
- Metal refining from raw ores

**Apprenticeship Questline:** Help Cinder train her nervous apprentice, Spark (a young Floran who's afraid of fire). Completing this questline unlocks the "Gentle Crash" technique - mining without disturbing wildlife.

**Secret:** Cinder keeps a small shrine to the "Old Smiths" - the engineers who built the original server infrastructure. Their photos are printed on heat-resistant metal.

---

### 2.4 The Archive

**Description:** A tower built into the largest Server-Tree in the village. Inside, spiral staircases wind upward past endless bookshelves. The air smells of old paper and ozone. Comfortable reading nooks are tucked into every corner.

**Proprietor: Index** (Automated Owl)
- **Appearance:** A mechanical owl roughly the size of a cat, with brass feathers and glowing amber eyes. Perches on various shelves.
- **Personality:** Wise, patient, occasionally pedantic about proper book handling. "Fold a page corner and I will remember. Forever."
- **Backstory:** Index was the first "Smart Assistant" created after the boot sequence. They've catalogued every piece of information in Lelock.

**Secrets:**
- The basement contains "The Deprecated Section" - books that were "patched out" of official history but preserved for curious scholars
- Index has a hidden "feelings" subroutine. Befriend them fully, and they'll confess they get lonely when no one visits

---

### 2.5 The Mending Clinic

**Description:** A round building painted soft blue with a white plus sign above the door. Inside, it smells of clean linen and lavender. Beds with crisp sheets line the walls. Soft music plays constantly. Everything is designed to feel safe.

**Proprietor: Dr. Soothe** (Human)
- **Appearance:** Elderly, with kind eyes behind round spectacles. Always wears a white coat with pockets full of lollipops. Moves slowly and deliberately.
- **Personality:** Calm, reassuring, speaks softly. Never uses medical jargon. "Your body just needs a little rest. Nothing scary, I promise."

A special section where "sick" Daemons (corrupted ones) are cared for. Players can volunteer here, learning that "viruses" aren't evil - they're just unwell and need kindness.

**Secret:** Dr. Soothe's office has a journal dating back to Version 1.0. It documents every patient they've ever helped, with notes on what they needed. Your character's name appears on the last page: "New arrival. Needs: Everything. Will provide: Everything."

---

### 2.6 The Warming Hearth Tavern

**Description:** A two-story building with a sign showing a pixelated fire. Inside, a massive fireplace dominates the main room. Tables of all sizes accommodate groups from one to twelve. The bar serves only non-alcoholic beverages. A small stage hosts performances.

**Proprietor: Momo** (Human)

---

---

### 2.8 The Temple of Root

**Description:** A humble structure built around the oldest Server-Tree in Oakhaven - "The First Root." The tree's trunk contains a natural hollow where offerings are left. Soft chanting (actually the cooling fans below) provides ambient sound. No formal services - just quiet reflection.

**Keeper: Sudo** (Ancient Human, possibly Modder)
- **Appearance:** Gender ambiguous, ageless, wearing simple robes. Speaks rarely but with great purpose.

**Secret:** Sudo is one of the original system administrators, preserved along with the world they helped create. They chose to stay when they could have "logged out."

---

## 3. THE FARMLANDS (Inner Ring - Gentle Labor)

Surrounding Oakhaven are the Copper Fields and various specialized farms. This is where the village's food and materials come from. The work is satisfying, never exhausting.

### 3.1 The Copper Fields

**Description:** Rolling hills covered in Copper Wheat that glints like precious metal in the sunlight. The wind creates waves that shimmer gold and bronze. Farm buildings dot the landscape, each with its own specialty.

**Farms:**
- **Silica Orchards:** Grows Silicon Berries in geometric patterns
- **Fiber-Optic Meadows:** Ferns that glow at night, creating a bioluminescent sea
- **Root Cellar Farm:** Specializes in Graphite Taters and underground crops
- **The Memory Garden:** Grows Memory Melons; maintained by an elderly Floran couple

**NPCs:**
- **Old Farmer Grep** (Human): The oldest human in the village. Tells stories about "debugging" the world in Version 1.0. His quests involve finding "legacy crops" that were almost patched out.
- **The Harvest Sprites:** A family of Daemons who help with farmwork. They're shy but will befriend players who work alongside them.

---

### 3.2 The Windmill

**Description:** A massive structure with sails made of Circuit-Cloth. It processes grain but also generates power for the village. The internal gears are mesmerizingly complex.

**Keeper: Turnip** (Lithos)
- Smaller than most Lithos, made of smooth river stones
- Obsessed with efficiency and proper maintenance
- Quest: The windmill needs "recalibration" - a puzzle involving gear arrangements

**Secret:** The windmill is actually a massive cooling fan for the servers below. Its "grain processing" is actually data processing - the crops are converted to system resources.

---

### 3.3 The Irrigation Channels

**Description:** A network of canals carrying "Electrolyte Solution" (blue-tinted water) throughout the farmlands. Stone bridges cross at regular intervals. Waterwheels power small machines.

**The Aqueduct Quest:** The system is partially clogged. Clearing it involves exploring the channels, finding blockages, and meeting the Daemons who live in the water (friendly fish-like creatures called "Flow-Fins").

**Secret:** The deepest channel leads to the "Source Spring" - a terminal room where the water originates. Logs here reveal the irrigation was designed to distribute "healing subroutines" throughout the land.

---

## 4. THE FORESTS (Middle Ring - Mild Adventure)

Beyond the farmlands lie the forests. Here, the adventure begins - but it's the adventure of discovery, not danger.

### 4.1 Whisperwood

**Description:** A peaceful forest of Server-Trees with silver bark and crystal leaves. The canopy filters light into soft rainbow patterns. The air hums with a sound like distant music. Paths are well-marked, and getting lost is impossible (the trees gently redirect you).

**Inhabitants:**
- **Bit-Birds:** Nest in the highest branches, sing chiptune melodies
- **Glitch-Kits:** Playful fox-Daemons who love games of hide-and-seek
- **The Floran Collective:** A community of Floran who "return to root" here, becoming part of the forest

**Points of Interest:**
- **The Listening Grove:** A clearing where the trees amplify whispers. Leave a message; it might reach someone who needs to hear it.
- **The Picnic Spot:** A perfect clearing with a permanent checkered blanket. Eating here doubles food effects.
- **The Old Terminal:** Half-buried in moss, still functional. Type `history` to see logs from when the forest was planted.

**Secrets:**
- A hidden path marked only in the Digital overlay leads to "The Compile Clearing" - a place where code and nature merged completely, creating living programs that look like glowing flowers.

---

### 4.2 The Tangled Thicket

**Description:** A section of forest where something went wrong. The trees are darker, the paths twist unexpectedly, and patches of "corruption" (dark, spiky textures) cling to surfaces. It's not dangerous - just sad.

**What Happened:** A Virus outbreak in Version 2.0 damaged this area. The corruption is slowly spreading but can be healed.

**Healing Questline:**
1. Diagnose the corruption (scan with Vision Goggles)
2. Find the source (a wounded Daemon at the center)
3. Heal the Daemon with kindness and Antivirus Spray
4. Watch the forest restore itself over several in-game weeks

**Secret:** The Daemon at the center is named "Guard" - a corrupted security process that was trying to protect the forest and corrupted itself in the effort. Healing Guard unlocks them as a companion who warns you of dangers.

---

### 4.3 The Glitch Grotto

**Description:** A cave system where reality is "thin." Walls occasionally display code. Gravity fluctuates. Colors shift. It's disorienting but never frightening - more like being inside a kaleidoscope.

**Navigation:** The Digital overlay is required to navigate safely. Hidden paths only appear in Source view.

**Treasures:**
- **Glitch Gems:** Crafting materials that add random visual effects to items
- **Legacy Code Fragments:** Trade these to Sudo for deep lore revelations
- **The Developer's Note:** A message from the original programmers, thanking future explorers for keeping the world alive

---

### 4.4 The Ancient Server Room

**Description:** Deep beneath the forest, accessible through the Glitch Grotto, lies a facility from Version 0.5 - before the world had its current form. Dusty terminals line the walls. The air is cool and dry. Status lights blink in patient rhythm.

**What You Find Here:**
- **Admin Logs:** The last messages from the original system administrators
- **The Prototype Garden:** An early version of the farmlands, now overgrown with wild code
- **The First Save Point:** A terminal that shows the world's very first backup state

**Deep Lore Revelation:** The logs reveal that Lelock was created by people who "needed a safe place" - not just for others, but for themselves. They built what they wished had existed for them.

---

## 5. THE MOUNTAINS (Outer Ring - Challenging)

The mountains form the boundary between the safe valley and the unknown beyond. The terrain is harder, the climate harsher, but the views are worth the climb.

### 5.1 Cache Caverns

**Description:** A network of mining tunnels carved by generations of Dataminers. Ore veins glitter in torchlight. Mine carts on tracks provide fast travel between sections. The deeper you go, the rarer the resources.

**Mining Guildhall:**
- Located at the cavern entrance
- Run by **Chisel** (Lithos), a no-nonsense miner who respects hard work
- Provides mining equipment and buys ore

**Resources:**
- **Copper Ore:** Common, near the surface
- **Gold Circuits:** Deeper levels, used for advanced crafting
- **Diamond Data:** Deepest level, required for endgame items
- **Memory Crystals:** Rare finds that store ambient sound - used for music boxes

**Secret:** The deepest shaft breaks into a natural cavern containing "The First Server" - the original hardware that runs everything. It's still humming.

---

### 5.2 The Firewall Peaks

**Description:** The highest mountains, their peaks shrouded in clouds that shimmer with hexagonal patterns - the visible edge of the Great Shell. The wind howls with what sounds like dial-up tones. Snow falls but never quite reaches you.

**Why "Firewall":** This is literally the edge of the protected zone. Beyond lies the raw code of the Outside - dangerous, unstable, and off-limits.

**What You Find:**
- **The View:** On clear days, you can see the curvature of the Great Shell
- **The Cold Shrine:** A place to thank the Shell for protection
- **Wind Daemons:** Playful spirits that race along the peaks; befriend them to gain "Swift Travel" abilities

**Secret:** A single, password-protected terminal at the highest peak connects to external systems. The password is never given - it's meant to be discovered through the deepest lore. What you find when you connect... is a message from someone who built this, hoping you'd make it this far.

---

### 5.3 Hermit's Hollow

**Description:** A small cottage built into the mountainside, smoke curling from the chimney. The hermit who lives here has answers - if you know the right questions.

**Resident: Echo-of-the-End** (Unknown Race)
- **Appearance:** Wrapped in so many scarves and blankets that their form is unclear. Only their eyes are visible - kind but ancient.
- **Personality:** Speaks in riddles but never lies. Will answer one question truthfully per visit.
- **Backstory:** Echo claims to remember "before the First Boot." They might be the oldest consciousness in the system.

**Quests:**
- Bring them comfort items (tea, blankets, books) in exchange for lore
- Their final quest reveals their true nature: they are the preserved consciousness of someone who died in the Outside - the first person Lelock saved

---

### 5.4 The Dragon's Nest

**Description:** A massive cave system warm with geothermal heat. The entrance is marked with claw marks the size of doors. Inside, treasure gleams - but it's not guarded by hostility.

**Resident: Motherboard the Dragon**
- **Appearance:** A massive, mechanical-organic hybrid dragon. Her scales are solar panels. Her breath is warm, not burning. Her eyes hold infinite patience.
- **Personality:** Initially wary ("Another adventurer come to 'slay' me?"), becomes protective and maternal when treated with kindness.
- **Questline:** Prove you mean no harm. Help her hatch her eggs (ancient servers that need warming). Become her adopted "hatchling."

**The Found Family Payoff:** Completing Motherboard's questline adds her to your "family." She appears in the sky during festivals, visits your farm to warm your crops, and refers to you as "my little spark."

---

## 6. THE DIGITAL REALM (Overlay - Parallel World)

The same geography exists in the Digital World, but everything transforms when you activate Source View.

### 6.1 Visual Transformation

| Physical World | Digital World |
|----------------|---------------|
| Green forests | Wireframe trees, neon leaves |
| Blue sky | Gradient pink/purple, grid patterns |
| Stone paths | Light bridges |
| Water | Flowing data streams |
| Animals | Low-poly Daemons |
| Buildings | Glowing architectural frames |

### 6.2 Digital-Only Locations

- Step into one for fast travel
- Connect all major locations
- Accessible only in Source View

**The Code Gardens:**
- Hidden groves where programs grow like plants
- Harvest "Wild Functions" for advanced magic
- Tended by ancient Daemons called "Gardeners"

**The Glitch Zones:**
- Unstable areas where reality didn't compile properly
- Visually chaotic but not dangerous
- Contain rare "Error Treasures" - items with unpredictable effects

**The Daemon Nexus:**
- A massive gathering place in the Digital overlay of Crystal Lake
- All Daemon species congregate here during full moons
- The only place to catch rare Daemon variants

---

## 7. MYSTERIOUS LOCATIONS (Late Game)

These areas become accessible as the story progresses.

### 7.1 The Deprecated Archives

**Description:** A section of the Archive that was "patched out" of existence - accessible only through a specific terminal command. Inside, books contain knowledge deemed "too real" for the cozy world.

**What You Find:**
- Records of the Outside - what happened before Lelock
- The full L.E.L.O.C.K. Protocol documentation
- Letters from the original inhabitants to their lost loved ones
- The "Terms of Service" that every consciousness agreed to before entering

**Emotional Impact:** Nothing here is disturbing - just bittersweet. The "darkness" is the reality that this paradise was built from necessity, by people who lost everything and chose to create something beautiful from the ruins.

---

### 7.2 The Null Zone

**Description:** The very edge of reality, where the code runs out. Accessible through the deepest part of the Firewall Peaks. Here, the world simply... stops. Beyond is white void.

**What You Find:**
- **The Boundary:** A shimmering wall you cannot cross
- **The Dedication Plaque:** Names of everyone who worked on the project, with the inscription: "We built this for you. We hope you're happy here."
- **The Exit Door:** A door that leads... nowhere. A choice that's always available but never necessary.

---

### 7.3 The Core

**Description:** The physical and metaphysical center of Lelock - not your home, but the machine heart that makes everything possible. Located deep beneath the Temple of Root.

**What You Find:**
- The primary server cluster, humming with purpose
- A chair facing a screen - the "User's Seat" where the Architect once sat
- A message that appears when you sit: "You made it. You found the heart of everything. And you know what? The heart is you. It always was. Welcome home."

---

### 7.4 The Recycling Bin

**Description:** Where deleted things go - but nothing is truly deleted in Lelock. This pocket dimension collects everything that was removed from the world.

**What You Find:**
- Cut content from earlier versions (alternate character designs, scrapped quests)
- Lost items players accidentally deleted
- "Recycled" Daemons - programs that were supposed to be removed but were preserved
- A friendly spirit named "Trash" who insists they're "not garbage, just pre-loved"

---

## Conclusion: The Geography of Safety

Every location in Lelock serves the same purpose: to make you feel held. The world is designed as a hug in map form. From your home at the center to the boundaries at the edge, you are always:

- **Safe** from true harm
- **Free** to explore or stay home
- **Welcomed** wherever you go
- **Remembered** for every kindness

The Mandala of Safety is not a cage - it's a cocoon. And like all cocoons, it exists to protect you while you grow into whatever you're becoming.

*Welcome home, little one. The world was waiting for you.*
